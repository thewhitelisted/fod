# Fod

## A simple game using pygame

This game was created by tofuu/thewhitelisted as a way to test the concepts of pygame.

## How do you play?

Your character is a square on the top left of the screen, you will try to "eat" the fod (blue squares), and avoid the white squares. Everytime you eat a fod, a new set of white squares spawn. If you collide with any of the white squares, you die!
